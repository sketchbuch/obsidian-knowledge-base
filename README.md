# Knowledge Base

An information resource created by [Sketchbuch](https://github.com/sketchbuch) to store information collected about web development, operating systems, and technology.

Although made in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), this is an Obsidian Vault and is best viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as MediaWiki style links are used throughout which are not recognised by Github as it is non-standard markdown.
