# Flutter

Information collected about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

Similar to [React](https://reactjs.org/), but uses classes rather than functions and has no [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). Flutter uses [[Dart]] rather than [[Javascript]].
