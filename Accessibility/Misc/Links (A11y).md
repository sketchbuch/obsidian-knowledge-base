## SC 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)

### A link contains text that gives a description of the information at that URI

A page contains the sentence "There was much bloodshed during the Medieval period of history." Where "Medieval period of history" is a link.  
  
### A link is preceded by a text description of the information at that URI  
  
A page contains the sentence "Learn more about the Government of Ireland's Commission on Electronic Voting at Go Vote!" where "Go Vote!" is a link.  
  
### Both an icon and text are included in the same link  
  
An icon of a voting machine and the text "Government of Ireland's Commission of Electronic Voting" are combined to make a single link. The alt text for the icon is null, since the purpose of the link is already described by the text of the link next to the icon.  
  
### A list of book titles  
  
A list of books is available in three formats: HTML, PDF, and mp3 (a recording of a person reading the book). To avoid hearing the title of each book three times (once for each format), the first link for each book is the title of the book, the second link says "PDF" and the third says, "mp3."  
  
### News article summaries  
  
A Web page contains a collection of news articles. The main page lists the first few sentences of each article, followed by a "Read more" link. A screen reader command to read the current paragraph provides the context to interpret the purpose of the link.
