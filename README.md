Although made in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), this is an Obsidian Vault and is best viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as MediaWiki style links are used throughout which are not recognised by Github as it is non-standard markdown.

## Obsidian Settings

This repo includes the .obsidian folder so that it is setup the way I want it, as well as incluing the plugins i use. Feel free to remove the .obsidian file before you use in Obsidian if you want different settings.
