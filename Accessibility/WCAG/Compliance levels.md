# Compliance levels

Information about WCAG Compliance levels.

---

The WCAG success criteria are all designed to be testable and are split into 3 levels of compliance:

| Level| Description                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------|
| A    | Some impact on design           |
| AA   | Medium impact on design         |
| AAA  | High / extreme impact on design |

Each level requires all criteria from the previous level to also be met.

> Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.

## A

This is the minimum level of compliance, and the easiest level to achieve, but it has so little benefit for users it is really not worth supporting on its own.

## AA

This is the level of compliance required for most accessibility laws including [[ADA]] and the EU [[WAD]]. The [[EAA]] does not have a specified compliance level but it is safe to assume that AA is required.

## AAA

This is the highest level of compliance and the hardest to achieve. In fact, the W3C mention in the specs that this level of compliance is probably impossible for most sites to achieve and certainly not possible on every page of sites that can.

> It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.
