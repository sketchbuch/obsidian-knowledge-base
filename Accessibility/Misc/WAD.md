# WAD

Information about EU Web Accessibility Directive ([WAD](https://web-directive.eu/)). This was a precursor to the [[EAA]] but for public sector websites and apps.

As of 2022, there is not a single public sector website or app in Germany that is fully compliant - according to the [Überwachungsstelle des Bundes für Barrierefreiheit](https://www.bfit-bund.de/) at [Web Accessibility Days at Google](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/web-cx-days/) in November - I gave a presentation here about making [MediaMarkt](https://www.mediamarkt.de/) accessible.
